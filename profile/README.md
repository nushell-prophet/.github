## Hi there 👋

It's an **unofficial organization** for collaborating on Nushell community projects that have not grown enough to be inside the NuShell organization. 

I wanted to name it NuBieHub, but my marketing background insisted that including "Nushell" in the name is important.

Nushell is awesome 🤘🚀
