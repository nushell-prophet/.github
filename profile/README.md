## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


This organization is a collection of Nushell-related projects by amateur junior developer [maxim-uvarov@github](https://github.com/maxim-uvarov) aka [nushell-prophet@github](http://github.com/nushell-prophet).

I record videos about my uses of Nushell on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@nushell-prophet ;)

I wanted to name this organization NuBieHub, but my marketing background insisted that including "Nushell" in the name is important. And if one might ask, "Isn't 'nushell-prophet' too loud a nickname for an amateur junior developer?" I will answer, "I don't know. We have a chance to see it together."

Even though I decently only Excel, M (Power Query) and Nushell.

Nushell is awesome ðŸ¤˜ðŸš€

P.S. All my works (including videos) are unlicensed. I would love for them to be used and reused in any projects, free and commercial, open and closed source.

I would love it if any of my ideas were rewritten in .nu or implemented in Rust.
