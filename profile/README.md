## Hi there 👋

This organization is a collection of Nushell-related projects by amateur junior developer [@maxim-uvarov](https://github.com/maxim-uvarov).

I wanted to name this organization NuBieHub, but my marketing background insisted that including "Nushell" in the name is important.

Nushell is awesome 🤘🚀
